			Fixing issues due to SELinux
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While installing CalFUSE 3.2.0 on Scientific Linux V 5.0 the following
SELinux issues came up. SELinux points to these web pages for a more
detailed explanation of the issues:
http://people.redhat.com/drepper/selinux-mem.html  and
http://people.redhat.com/drepper/textrelocs.html

A suggestion from the http://people.redhat.com/drepper/textrelocs.html
web page is to compile the c libraries with -fpic or -fPIC.

The first SELinux issue maybe related to this being a new install of Scientific Linux and
not truly related to CalFUSE. 


Summary
-------

SELinux is preventing access to files with the label, file_t.

Detailed Description

SELinux permission checks on files labeled file_t are being
denied. file_t is the context the SELinux kernel gives to files that do not have a label.
This indicates a serious labeling problem. No files on an SELinux box should ever be
labeled file_t. If you have just
added a new disk drive to the system you can relabel it using the restorecon command.
Otherwise you should relabel the entire files system.

Allowing Access

You can execute the following command as root to relabel your computer
system:

touch /.autorelabel; reboot

Note that this will reboot your computer system.


Summary
-------

SELinux is preventing /calfuse/v3.2/bin/cf_hist_init from loading
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libcf.so,
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libsla.so, and
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libcfitsio-2.470.so
which require text relocation.


Detailed Description

The /calfuse/v3.2/bin/cf_hist_init application attempted to load
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libcf.so,
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libsla.so, and
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libcfitsio-2.470.so
which require text relocation. This is a potential security problem. Most libraries do
not need this permission.  Libraries are sometimes coded incorrectly and request this
permission. The SELinux Memory Protection Tests web page explains how to remove this
requirement. You can configure SELinux temporarily to allow
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libcf.so,
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libsla.so, and
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libcfitsio-2.470.so
to use relocation as a workaround, until the libraries are fixed.
Please file a bug report against this package.

Allowing Access

If you trust
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libcf.so,
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libsla.so, and
/calfuse/v3.2/lib/libcfitsio-2.470.so
to run correctly, you can change the file context to textrel_shlib_t.

The following commands will allow this access:

chcon -t textrel_shlib_t /calfuse/v3.2/lib/libcf.so
chcon -t textrel_shlib_t /calfuse/v3.2/lib/libsla.so
chcon -t textrel_shlib_t /calfuse/v3.2/lib/libcfitsio-2.470.so
