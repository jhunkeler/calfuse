                       INSTALLING A FORTRAN COMPILER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that these are solutions that we tried and therefore recommend,
especially since they worked on every machine we tried, but there might be other
solutions if none of this works for you.  Just google fortran and your machine
specs and you should find some ideas.


FORTRAN for Solaris:
--------------------

	CalFUSE has been compiled and tested on Solaris with the Fortran
	compilers provided by SUN (f77 and f90) and GNU (g77 and gfortran).
	Both are available for free, so even if you already have another fortran
	compiler, you should get one of these.  Other Fortran compilers may
	work, but we cannot guarantee your results.

    ->  We recommend that you first try the Sun Studio Compilers from Sun's
	development website:
	http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/index.jsp
	CalFUSE compiles properly with version 12.

    ->  An old version of Fortran may already exist on your machine.  Look for
	the old 'libF77.so' and 'libM77.so' libraries in one of these
	directories: '/usr/4lib' and '/opt/SUNWspro/lib/'.  They would probably
	have a name with a version number at the end.  If so, you can try to
	create symbolic links to these two (with the command 'ln -s <library>
	<link>') using their exact names 'libF77.so' and 'libM77.so'.  Then add
	to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable the directory in which you
	created the two links.  Also add '/opt/SUNWspro/bin/' to your PATH and
	try again to run the CalFUSE configure routine.

    ->  Otherwise, you can try to install 'g77' from the GNU compilers by
	installing the package 'gcc-3.4.6'.  (We were unable to make 'gfortran'
	from GCC version 4 and higher work on Solaris.)  You will need root
	access to do so.

	First type the command 'iconv' in your shell.  If it returns "command
	not found", then you must first install the package libiconv as well.

	You can retrieve packages for various versions of Solaris (7 to 10) and
	different CPU architectures (Sparc or Intel) from this website (select
	the appropriate system/CPU combination in the menu on the right side):
	http://www.sunfreeware.com

	If the web page download fails, you can access the packages by ftp
	( where  <CPU> = sparc or intel  and  <V> = 7, 8, 9 or 10 ):
	   ftp ftp.sunfreeware.com
	   login: anonymous
	   password: <your_email_address>
	   binary			   
	   cd pub/freeware/<CPU>/<V>/
	   get gcc-3.4.6-sol<V>-<CPU>-local.gz
	   get libiconv-1.11-sol<V>-<CPU>-local.gz    (if iconv is missing)
	   bye

	When you have the necessary packages, first add '/usr/local/bin' to your
	PATH environment variable and '/usr/local/man' to your MANPATH.  Then
	unzip the packages with 'gunzip' and, as root, type the following
	commands:
	   > pkgadd -d libiconv-1.9.2-sol<V>-<CPU>-local (if iconv is missing)
	   > pkgadd -d gcc-3.4.6-sol<V>-<CPU>-local

    ->  You can also try to recompile the GCC compilers yourself from the source
	available on the GNU website:
	http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/
	But this is a very long (it took us 10 hours) and complicated process,
	and we recommend that you install the package as described above.

	If you really have to compile the code by hand, for example because
	you cannot get root permission, follow these instructions:
	- Choose the latest 3.x.x version available.  (We were unable to
	install fortran version 4.x.x because the necessary libraries were
	missing.)
	- Create three directories, none of them a subdirectory of another: 
	srcdir - to contain the source archive
	bindir - where the binaries will be installed 
	insdir - from which you will do the install
	For example, I had respectively '/home/ooghe/gcc/src/',
	'/home/ooghe/gcc/bin/' and '/home/ooghe/gcc/install/'.
	- Unzip and untar the downloaded archive in 'srcdir'
	- Echo your 'PATH' environment variable and remove '/usr/ucb/bin'
	from it if it is present. Add '/usr/sfw/bin' if it is not.
	For example:
	   > export PATH=/usr/bin:/etc:/usr/sbin:/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:.
	- Do the following:
	   > export CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/ksh
	- Go to 'insdir' and do the following:
	   > 'srcdir'/configure --prefix='bindir' --enable-languages=c,fortran
	where 'srcdir' and 'gccdir' should be complete path directories, e.g.,
	'/home/username/gcc/src' and '/home/username/gcc/bin'
	- Bootstrap and finally install the compiler:
	   > gmake bootstrap
	   > gmake install
	- Add 'bindir'/bin to your PATH environment variable, and
	'bindir'/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH one.

FORTRAN for Linux:
------------------

	CalFUSE has been compiled and tested on Linux with the Fortran compilers
	provided by GNU (g77 and gfortran).  They are available for free, so
	even if you already have another fortran compiler, you should get one of
	these.  You can try to make CalFUSE work with another compiler, but we
	cannot guarantee your results.

	Most Linux distributions include one of the GNU Fortran compilers, but
	if it is not on yours, you should first try to get a binary for your
	machine.

    ->  If your Linux is based on a distribution like Debian, Fedora or SUSE,
	look for a binary on this web page:
	http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranDistros

    ->  Otherwise, you can try to install the latest binary from this web page,
	but we do not recommend it because the latest compilers may still contain
	some bugs:
	http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries

    ->  If you do not have any other solution, you should recompile GCC from the
	source by following the instructions available on 
	http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries
	

===============================================================================

FORTRAN for MAC OS X:
---------------------

	
	CalFUSE has been compiled and tested on MAC OS X with the Fortran
	compilers provided by GNU (g77 and gfortran).  They are available for
	free, so even if you already have another Fortran compiler (like ifort
	from Intel or f77 from ABSoft), you should get one of these.  You can
	try to make CalFUSE work with another compiler, but we cannot guarantee
	your results.

	There are many ways to install the GNU compilers on a MAC;
	here are some suggestions:

    ->	For Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or higher, we know that the installation
	provided on this web page works well: 
        http://www.macresearch.org/xcode_gfortran_contest_winner_damien_bobillot
  	Just download the gfortran compiler corresponding to your CPU
	architecture (Intel or PowerPC) and follow the "gfortran compiler
	instructions".

        If this web page is down, you can get the same archives from the
	CalFUSE FTP site:

	   ftp fuse.pha.jhu.edu
	   login: anonymous
	   password: <your_email_address>

	   cd fuseftp/calfuse
	   binary
  (PPC)	   get macos-gfortran-intel-bin.tar.gz
 (Intel)   get macos-gfortran-ppc-bin.tar.gz
	   bye

	When you have the appropriate package, install the compiler
	using the following command:
  (PPC)    sudo tar -zxvf macos-gfortran-ppc-bin.tar.gz -C /
 (Intel)   sudo tar -zxvf macos-gfortran-intel-bin.tar.gz -C /

	Note: It is possible that /usr/local/bin is not in your default
	PATH environment variable.  If the command 'gfortran' does not work,
	then, assuming you're using the default bash shell, type
	(or include in /etc/profile):
	   > export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

    ->  Otherwise, you can try to find more recent versions of these
	packages on these different websites, but we don't recommend them
	because they usually still have a few development bugs:
	http://hpc.sourceforge.net/
	http://www.macresearch.org/xcode_gfortran_plugin_update
	http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinariesMacOS

    ->  You can also try to install yourself a version of gfortran or
	g77 from one of GCC releases at this address:
	http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/
	This might be the only solution if you are using Mac OS X 10.3
	or lower.
 	In this specific case, we recommend that you try first to install
	'g77' from 'gcc-3.3.3', following Jeff's instructions as follows:

Hi All-

I have successfully installed GNU fortran on my Mac laptop.
It is not part of the Apple Developer tools (at least not anymore),
so you have to get it directly from GNU.  The instructions from GNU
state that you need the whole source tree to compile the compilers,
so you have to ignore the portions of the GCC package that are provided
by Apple with their developers toolkit.

After reading through lots of instructions, I concluded that all the
default options were just fine.  So, here is a boiled-down set of
instructions.

You will need 3 different directories:
srcdir:  where you put all the files from GNU
objdir:  where you do the build
installdir:  this defaults to /usr/local, which is what I used.
(You may have to do this as root to put things in /usr/local)

The one complication is that GNU "strongly recommends" that none of
these directories be subdirectories of one another.
So I put the downloaded files in /Users/kruk/Desktop/gcc-3.3.3
and I did the build in /Users/kruk/gcc/bin.

Here's the sequence of commands needed:

1) Use your browser to go to
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/releases/gcc-3.3.3
click on gcc-3.3.3.tar.gz
unpack this in 'srcdir' (in my case this was ~/Desktop/gcc-3.3.3)

2) Make the directory where you will do the build.  In my case this was:
> cd ~
> mkdir gcc
> mkdir bin
> cd gcc/bin

3) Configure all the files:
> ~/Desktop/gcc-3.3.3/configure

4) Make the compilers:
> gnumake bootstrap
(I think the default 'make' is the same as gnumake, but I wasn't taking
any chances)
When this completes, there are no files in /usr/local yet!

5) Do the actual install:
> gnumake install

[This can take a long time -- up to 90 minutes.  - Ed.]

That's it!

Note: If you are using an Intel-based Mac, also follow these instructions
      from Vincent Hénault-Brunet: "I recently compiled CalFUSE on my Mac
      Intel laptop. The problem had to do with g77.  I didn't know, but g77
      doesn't work on Mac Intel. It will compile but doesn't work properly.
      I had to patch the power-pcc version of g77 (patch found at
      http://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~wookey/MEFTLG/g77.htm ), and CalFUSE 
      compiled without any problem."
