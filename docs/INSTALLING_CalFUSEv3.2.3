-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         INSTALLING CalFUSE v3.2.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions cover Solaris, Linux, Linux 64, and Mac OS X
installations.

You will need at least 1.6 GB of disk space to install the pipeline and
its associated calibration files.

The software is in the tar file cfv3.2.3.sw.tar.gz

The calibration files are divided among three tar files:

cfv3.2.3.cala.tar.gz	<-- Cal files that start with letter a
cfv3.2.3.calg.tar.gz	<-- Cal files that start with letter g
cfv3.2.3.calz.tar.gz	<-- All other cal files


A. DOWNLOADING THE CALFUSE SOFTWARE AND ASSOCIATED CALIBRATION FILES:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	Obtain the compressed tar files:

		prompt> ftp fuse.pha.jhu.edu
		login: anonymous
		password: <your_email_address>

		cd fuseftp/calfuse
		binary
		get cfv3.2.3.sw.tar.gz
		get cfv3.2.3.cala.tar.gz
		get cfv3.2.3.calg.tar.gz
		get cfv3.2.3.calz.tar.gz
		bye

	Uncompress and extract all tarfiles in your calfuse directory.


B. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-----------------------------

0) Note for all systems:

	You need to type "make -e install" only once, not in each
	subdirectory.


1) SOLARIS

	First check whether '/opt/SUNWspro/lib' is in your
	'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable.  If it is not, be
	sure to add it.

	In [calfuse_directory]/v3.2/src, type:

	    make distclean
	    chmod +x configure.solaris
	    ./configure.solaris
	    make clean
	    make -e install
	
	The Solaris operating system should come with a Fortran
	compiler; however, if the configure routine returns an error
	message about Fortran, it is probably missing, and you will
	have to install it.  To do so, follow the instructions for
	Solaris in the file INSTALLING_A_FORTRAN_COMPILER.


2) LINUX and LINUX 64

	If you are running Linux on a 64-bit machine, you must also
	install a 64-bit version of the CFITSIO library.  You
	can skip this step if your machine is running in 32-bit
	mode.  The operation may require root access to your system,
	so you may have to ask for help from your system manager.
	First use your 'Applications/Add-Remove Software'
	tool to see whether CFITSIO is available by default on
	your system (as it is for Scientific Linux version 5.0).
	If so, install it; if not, you can download the release
	corresponding to your operating system from the Internet.
	Search for 'cfitsio' on the web page http://rpm.pbone.net/.
	If this page is not available, search the FITSIO webpage
	(http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html)
	for RPM format distributions.

	Once the necessary libraries are installed, move to the
	directory [calfuse_directory]/v3.2/src and type

	    make distclean
	    chmod +x configure.linux    or   chmod +x configure.linux64
	    ./configure.linux	    	or   ./configure.linux64
	    make clean
	    make -e install
	
	Notes:
	
	a) GCC should come with a Fortran compiler; however, if the
	configure routine returns an error message about Fortran,
	it is probably missing, and you will have to install it.
	To do so, follow the instructions for Linux in the file
	INSTALLING_A_FORTRAN_COMPILER.

	b) If the compilation fails with an error such as:
	"undefined reference to '_gfortran_pow_i4_i4'" or similar,
	it probably means you have both g77 and gfortran installed.
	In this case we recommand that you try to remove the gfortran
	package from your Linux distribution (using synaptic, apt-get
	or aptitude, for example).

	c) Linux64 users: If you installed cfitsio in a directory
	other than the usual '/usr/include/cfitsio', determine the
	path you used, for example '/usr/local/cfitsio64' and, in
	[calfuse_directory]/v3.2/src, type the following commands,
	where <new_path> is the path identified above:

	    cp configure.linux64 configure.linux64.sv
	    sed -e "s#/usr/include/cfitsio#<new_path>#g#" \
	    	configure.linux64.sv > configure.linux64.sv2
	    sed -e "s/#cfit/     /g"  \
	    	configure.linux64.sv2 > configure.linux64

	Then restart the installation procedure.
	
	d) If you encounter trouble with SELinux while installing
	CalFUSE, you should read the informations from Michael Van
	Steenberg in the file FIXING_SELINUX_ISSUES.


3) MAC OS X

	In [calfuse_directory]/v3.2/src type

	    make distclean
	    chmod +x configure.macosx
	    ./configure.macosx
	    make clean
	    make -e install

	Notes:

	a) CalFUSE requires Mac OS X 10.2 or higher.

	b) CalFUSE uses both the C and Fortran compilers.  If you
	   are running OS X 10.3 or above, you probably have a C
	   compiler.  If not, retrieve the Xcode suite of developer
	   tools from the Apple Developer Connection website
	   (developer.apple.com).  To obtain the Fortran compiler,
	   follow the instructions for MacOS in the file
	   INSTALLING_A_FORTRAN_COMPILER.

	c) If the linker complains about missing library routines,
	   you may need to modify the definition of LIBS in the various
	   Makefiles.  For example, you may need to replace "-L/usr/local/lib"
	   with "-L/sw/lib".

	d) For best results, run CalFUSE in an X11 window; otherwise,
	   your trailer files will be full of warning messages from IDL.

	e) FYI: the environment variable called 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'
	   on other systems is called 'DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH' by Mac OS.


C. SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
-------------------------------------

	The directory '[calfuse_directory]/v3.2/bin' contains the
	scripts 'cfsetup.sh' and 'cfsetup.csh', which define the
	environment variables needed by CalFUSE.  You will run one
	of these two depending on the shell you are using.

	Usually, if you are on a Solaris machine or on a Mac running
	OS X 10.2, you will use the '.csh' script.  On Linux and
	more recent versions of MAC OS X, you should probably use
	the '.sh' script.  If one gives you an error message, try
	the other.

	The scripts assume that you have installed the pipeline in
	your home directory.  If you have installed it elsewhere,
	you must edit the script, changing the root CalFUSE directory
	('CF_DIR') defined at the beginning.

	If you are using the '.csh' script, do the following:
	    source cfsetup.csh
	    rehash
	If you are using the '.sh' script, do the following:
	    source cfsetup.sh
	    hash -r	
	
	You can also insert the whole script into your '.login'
	file, in which case the environment variables will be set
	each time you log in.


D. RUNNING THE PIPELINE:
------------------------

	To run the pipeline on either timetag or histogram
	data, just type 'calfuse' followed by the name of the raw
	data file. For example:

		calfuse P99901010011attagfraw.fit
		calfuse P99901010011ahistfraw.fit
